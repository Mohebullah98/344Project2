Steps to run Poject 2
1. Open 2 command prompts and access the source code directory in both
2. On the first command prompt compile all the code with "javac *.java" command
3. Then run the server with "java Server"
4. On the second Command prompt, compile all the code with "javac *.java" command
5. Then run the client with "java Client"
-Make sure to have both command prompts side by side to see all the connection establishments on the first CMD and the original output from project 1 
on the 2nd CMD.
If you wish to run again, just run the Client side program again because the server will wait indefinitely for incoming requests.
